# Statistical Computing and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Comprehensive Tutorial Report on Adult Bank Marketing and Student Performance Datasets

### Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial report created for Dr. Haolun Shi's STAT342 class at Simon Fraser University. The report demonstrates the use of two powerful SAS techniques: PROC TABULATE and PROC SGPLOT, applied to three different datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Datasets Used
1. **Adult Dataset**: [Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) - Contains data about adults, ideal for studying socioeconomic issues.
2. **Bank Marketing Dataset**: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) - Provides information about bank marketing campaigns.
3. **Student Performance Dataset**: [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) - Offers insights into student performance metrics.

### Tools and Techniques
- **PROC TABULATE**: Used for creating detailed tables to extract and summarize data.
- **PROC SGPLOT**: Utilized for generating statistical graphics to highlight patterns and relationships within the data.

### Contents
The report covers the following:
1. **Data Loading and Initial Processing**: Steps for importing and preparing the datasets for analysis.
2. **Tabulation and Visualization**: Detailed procedures for creating tables and plots.
3. **Interpretation of Results**: Insights and observations derived from the analysis.

### How to Use This Tutorial
This tutorial is designed for students to follow along and replicate the analyses on their own machines. It provides a step-by-step guide to mastering the use of SAS software for data analysis.
